## Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a group of photos I screen shoted of different tasks I was given on a Intro to Programming With Python course via Zybooks. I took the course during my winter - mid summer term at WGU. 
I found this class to be challenging as I had never used Python before. However by the end of the course I ended up really enjoying programming and ended up doing well on the exam.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I plan on completing some actual python projects in the near future. But until then I wanted to be able to showcase my work thus far. I am considering this a work in progress and 
understand that the format could be better and plan to improve as time alots me. But for now this atleast can provide a general overview of my logic.

## Purpose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this is to showcase my logic on solving a given problem using Python, so that anyone looking at my portfolio can atleast get an idea on how I break
down a problem and then provide a solution.

## Problems/Soltuions
